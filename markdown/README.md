# Emphasis

In only 60 years, the field of *computing and information systems* has redefined the traditional ways of business, education, government, and entertainment.  Virtually every organization and every field of study rely on computers and related technologies to succeed in the _Information Age_.  Even our everyday vocabulary embraces words like The Internet, email, Google, Facebook, YouTube, MP3, ATM, and Wii.
